- Launch Concept [Y] — repurpose existing footage with new copy

### Week 2-3 (Medium Lift)
- Produce Concept [Z] — requires new footage/assets
- A/B test hooks from Concepts [X] and [Y] based on Week 1 results

### Measurement
- **Primary metric**: CTR + CPA at ad level
- **Secondary**: Hook hold rate (3-second video views / impressions)
- **Decision rule**: Kill after 3 days if CPA > 2x target; scale if CPA < target
