## How Meta Ad Library Works

### Key Facts
- **US Library = Active ads only**: Shows only ads currently running on Facebook/Instagram
- **EU-targeted ads**: Archived for 12 months; political ads for 7 years
- **Non-political US ads**: No history retention beyond active period
- **Delay**: Ads appear ~24 hours after first impression
- **Expiration**: Links to specific ads break once the ad stops running

### What You See vs Don't See
**Available**: Publisher page name, start date, placement (FB vs IG), headline, text, CTA, creative (image/video)

**NOT Available**: Clicks, conversions, spend, impressions (except EU/DSA data)

### Critical Actions
- **Always screenshot/download creative immediately** - don't rely on Library links
- **Save media locally** with systematic naming: `Brand_Angle_Date.png`
- **"Low count" label** = <100 impressions, likely a test (ignore for winner analysis)

## Winning Ad Proxies

Since conversion data isn't visible, use these signals to identify likely winners:

### 1. Longevity
Ads running for weeks/months often indicate winners. Brands kill losers quickly.

**Validate**: Check for fresh engagement (comments/likes still coming) and new variations of same angle launching.

**Failure mode**: Could be low $/day test, retargeting ad, or simply forgotten.

### 2. Creative Families & Variants
Brands duplicate winning ads into "families" with minor tweaks (hook phrasing, image, placement).

Multiple ads for same product with minor variations = A/B testing. Longest-running version likely performs best.

**Validate**: Multiple textures of same theme = good sign of investment.

### 3. Consistency of Message
Same angle/offer repeated across multiple ads = proven resonance.

Example: If all their ads promise "stress relief through pottery," they found that works.

### 4. Offer Persistence
If a discount/bundle stays unchanged across many ads, it likely drives conversions.

Example: "Free shipping + bonus clay pack" appearing repeatedly = converting offer.

**Validate**: Compare to seasonal promotions - if offer persists even on non-holidays, it's steady performer.

### 5. Breadth of Testing (Formats & Placements)
Brands confident in an angle test it across multiple formats (video, static, carousel) and placements (Feed, Stories, Reels).

If same creative appears in both IG Reel AND Facebook banner, they're scaling that angle.

### 6. Cross-Brand Signals
Watch for convergence - if multiple brands in the niche run ads with similar hooks, that angle is trending.

Independent discovery of same idea = likely tested and working.

## Building a Competitor Set

### In-League vs Out-of-League
**In-League**: Similar size/channel brands (other DTC pottery/ceramics kits). Share budgets and audience. Primary focus.

**Out-of-League**: Large craft retailers or big home decor brands. Scan for ideas but don't copy high-gloss production. Scale back to DTC level.

### Adjacent / "Job-to-be-Done" Competitors
Brands solving same customer need differently:
- Pottery wheel competes with "kids STEM kits" for gift/creativity angle
- Travel mug competes with premium thermos for commute/quality angle

Indirect competitors reveal creative ideas and emotional hooks without directly copying your niche.

### Brand Positioning Filter
Use Mark Ritson's insight: If every competitor is pitching "low price," position on premium craftsmanship.

When choosing competitors, pick some who compete on **brand** (story, quality) vs those who go hard on **discounts** - see different strategies.

### Regional/Seasonal
- Track EU-based ads (archived longer, more history available)
- Include seasonal gift brands (holiday-themed ads indicate upcoming trends)

## Daily/Weekly Workflow

### Quick Scan (60-90 min)
1. Pick 2-3 competitors
2. Set filters: Country=US, Category=All Ads, Active Only
3. Search by brand name or product keyword
4. Aim for ~10 ads total across competitors
5. Tag each quickly (angle/hook) - don't go deeper than first page of results

### For Each Ad, Record
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Brand | Competitor name |
| Date Found | Today's date |
| Angle/Theme | Short tag of main idea |
| Hook Snippet | First line or scene |
| Offer/Price | If any |
| Proof | Testimonials, stats, awards shown |
| Format | Video/static/carousel |
| Placement | Feed/Stories/Reels |

### Weekly Review (30 min)
1. Review the log - delete duplicates, refine tags
2. Bump promising angles to top of backlog
3. Brainstorm 2-3 ad briefs from top findings
4. Pick single most convincing new angle to test
5. Share key findings in one-pager for team

### Stay on Schedule
- Limit each scan to 1h or 3 competitors max
- Breadth > Depth: Better to cover 3 brands shallowly than 1 obsessively
- The Library is a *hunting* tool, not a wading pool

## Common Pitfalls

### Research Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring inactive = historical**: US non-political ads vanish once stopped
2. **Not saving assets**: URLs expire! Screenshot/download immediately
3. **Overtrusting impressions**: Library shows no spend/imps outside EU
4. **Copying big-brand style**: Fortune 500 budgets ≠ SME reality. Focus on idea/hook, not polish
5. **Forgetting low-count cues**: "Low count" = test, not winner

### Strategic Pitfalls
6. **Neglecting brand fit**: Drop angles that conflict with your positioning
7. **Chasing frills over substance**: Focus on angle/hook, not editing tricks
8. **Not organizing research**: Use structured logs, not random screenshots
9. **Missing creative families**: Group variants, don't look at single ads in isolation
10. **Missing offer persistence**: Repeated offers = working offers

## If You Only Do 3 Things

1. **Scan & Save**: Pick 3 competitors, capture creatives + copy of long-running/eye-catching ads. Store them now.

2. **Extract Angles**: For each saved ad, identify core angle (benefit) and hook. Write "Promise/Pain" in your backlog. The insight is in the message.

3. **Align & Test**: Take top 1-2 angles that fit your brand, run quick ad tests. Rapid iteration on a few hypotheses outperforms researching endlessly.
