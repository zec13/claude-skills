## 1. Question Writing Rules

### Clarity
- Write at 8th-grade reading level
- One concept per question (no double-barreled questions)
- Avoid jargon unless testing category-specific knowledge
- Define ambiguous terms inline

### Structure
- Lead with the most important information
- Use consistent tense throughout
- Match question format to data need (select one vs. select all)

### Bad vs. Good Examples

**Double-barreled (BAD):**
> How satisfied are you with the price and quality of this product?

**Single concept (GOOD):**
> How satisfied are you with the price of this product?
> How satisfied are you with the quality of this product?

**Leading (BAD):**
> Don't you agree that Brand X provides superior protection?

**Neutral (GOOD):**
> How would you rate Brand X's protection compared to other brands?

## 2. Response List Design

### MECE Principle
Response options must be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive:
- No overlap between options
- All possible answers covered
- Include "Other" and "None" when appropriate

### Parallel Phrasing
All options should use the same grammatical structure:

**BAD:**
- Price is too high
- Quality concerns
- I don't trust the brand
- Availability

**GOOD:**
- Price is too high
- Quality does not meet my expectations
- I do not trust the brand
- Product is not available where I shop

### List Length
- Maximum 15 options per question
- If more needed, consider splitting into categories or using two-stage selection
- Randomize to prevent order bias (except anchored items)

### Anchored Items
Always anchor at the end (do not randomize):
- "None of the above"
- "I don't know / Not sure"
- "Other (Please specify)"
- "Prefer not to answer"

Mark as mutually exclusive when appropriate.

## 3. Bias Prevention

### Acquiescence Bias
People tend to agree with statements. Mitigate by:
- Using balanced scales (agree/disagree)
- Mixing positive and negative framing
- Avoiding leading language

### Social Desirability Bias
People underreport undesirable behaviors. Mitigate by:
- Normalizing language: "Some people... How about you?"
- Using ranges instead of exact numbers
- Ensuring anonymity is clear

### Order Effects
Response order affects selection. Mitigate by:
- Randomizing option order
- Rotating scale direction across respondents
- Anchoring "don't know" and "none" options

### Primacy/Recency Effects
First and last options get more selections. Mitigate by:
- Randomization
- Balanced list construction

## 4. Readability Standards

### Target: 8th Grade Reading Level

**Techniques:**
- Short sentences (15-20 words max)
- Common words over technical terms
- Active voice over passive
- Concrete over abstract

### Formatting for Clarity
- Bold key terms when defining
- Use parenthetical examples: "flea and tick products (such as collars, pills, or spot-on treatments)"
- Break complex concepts into multiple questions
