1. Tell me which prompt to run (by number or name)
2. Provide the inputs (I'll ask for anything missing)

**Tips**: Layer prompts — run 3A (Deep Research) first, then feed the output into 1A (Ad Creative Producer) for research-backed ads. Iterate surgically ("make the hooks punchier") rather than restarting.
