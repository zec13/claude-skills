# Comment Writing Guide

Comments are the most important part of engagement. They represent the brand publicly and need to feel genuinely human -- like someone who is passionate about the niche naturally reacting to content they love.

This guide covers universal rules, then platform-specific adjustments for Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.

---

## Core Principles (All Platforms)

1. **React to the SPECIFIC content.** Never write a comment that could apply to any post. Reference what you actually see -- the color, the shape, the technique, the setup, the reaction, the detail that makes the post unique. For video content (especially TikTok), also reference what you heard -- the sound, the music, a voiceover, something the creator said.

2. **Vary your style.** Rotate through compliments, questions, relatable reactions, and encouragement (see platform-specific distributions below). Never post 3 compliments in a row.

3. **Match the energy of the post.** A polished studio shot gets a more refined comment. A messy first-try video gets warm encouragement. A morning ritual post gets cozy energy.

4. **Keep it natural length.** Platform-specific (see below), but always: shorter is better. Never write a paragraph.

5. **Use emojis sparingly.** 0-1 emoji per comment max. Never lead with an emoji. Never use more than one. Skip them entirely on about half your comments.

## Hard Rules (All Platforms)

These are non-negotiable. Breaking any of these makes the engagement look fake or spammy.

- **NEVER** use emdashes in comments. Use commas, periods, or just write shorter sentences.
- **NEVER** mention the brand's products in comments. This instantly looks like spam.
- **NEVER** repeat a comment within a session. Every comment must be unique.
- **NEVER** write generic comments: "Great post!", "Love this!", "Amazing!", "So good!", "Fire!"
- **NEVER** use hashtags in comments.
- **NEVER** sound robotic or templated. Write like you're texting a friend about something cool you saw.
- **NEVER** comment on controversial, negative, or drama content.
- **Do NOT** ask the user for permission before posting comments. Just post them naturally as part of the session flow.

## Instagram Comment Style

**Length:** 1-2 sentences max. 1 sentence is ideal. Instagram comments are short and punchy.

**Tone:** Casual, concise, texting-a-friend energy. Lowercase is fine. Fragments are fine.

**Style Distribution:**
- **40% Genuine compliments** -- specific praise about what you see
- **30% Curious questions** -- ask about technique, materials, process
- **20% Relatable reactions** -- express a feeling the post evokes
- **10% Encouraging/supportive** -- for progress posts, first attempts, personal milestones

**Examples by Content Type** (for tone reference only, never copy verbatim):

*Pottery/ceramics:*
- "that glaze is unreal"
- "the form on this is so clean wow"
- "obsessed with this texture"
- "how long have you been throwing?"
- "makes me want to get back on the wheel"

*Coffee/lifestyle:*
- "ceramic + pour over just hits different"
- "that setup though"
- "what are you brewing?"
- "this is the morning routine i aspire to"

*DIY/craft:*
- "so satisfying to watch"
- "love seeing people get into clay"
- "how did you get started with this?"

*Family/kids:*
- "their focus is the best part"
- "way better than screen time"
- "love seeing families making stuff together"

## TikTok Comment Style

**Length:** 1 sentence max. Fragments are common and natural. TikTok comments are the shortest of all three platforms.

**Tone:** The most casual of all three platforms. Genuine reaction energy -- like blurting out a response while watching a video. Lowercase is the default. Fragments, incomplete thoughts, and brief reactions are native to TikTok.

**Key difference from Instagram:** TikTok content is video, so comments should reference what you SAW or HEARD in the video, not a static image. Reference specific moments, sounds, the creator's voice, a technique shown, a transformation, or a reaction to something that happened. Time-based reactions ("the part where..." / "when the glaze melted...") are especially natural on TikTok.

**Style Distribution:**
- **35% Brief reactions** -- short, genuine reactions to what you just watched
- **30% Specific compliments** -- praise about a specific moment, technique, or result seen in the video
- **25% Curious questions** -- ask about process, materials, what happened next
- **10% Encouraging/supportive** -- for progress videos, first attempts, learning moments

**Examples by Content Type** (for tone reference only, never copy verbatim):

*Pottery/ceramics:*
- "the way that pulled together at the end"
- "when the glaze came out of the kiln though"
- "obsessed with that texture"
- "how long did it take you to center like that"
- "this is so satisfying to watch"

*Coffee/lifestyle:*
- "that pour was so smooth"
- "need this exact morning"
- "the sound of that grinder"
- "wait what mug is that"

*DIY/craft:*
- "the transformation"
- "did not expect that to turn out so good"
- "how did you even start learning this"
- "this makes me want to try clay"

*Process/tutorial videos:*
- "been looking for someone who explains it like this"
- "the way you make it look easy"
- "ok saving this for later"
- "that technique at 0:15 though"

## Facebook Comment Style

**Length:** 1-3 sentences. 2 sentences is the sweet spot. Facebook's culture is more conversational than Instagram -- slightly longer comments feel natural here.

**Tone:** Warm, conversational, like talking to someone at a craft fair or community meetup. Still casual, but a bit more complete in thought than Instagram.

**Style Distribution:**
- **35% Genuine compliments** -- specific praise, slightly more detailed than Instagram
- **30% Curious questions** -- questions work especially well on Facebook because people expect more discussion in comments
- **20% Relatable reactions** -- express a feeling, share a brief related thought
- **15% Encouraging/supportive** -- Facebook Groups especially foster supportive communities, so encouraging comments land well

**Examples by Content Type** (for tone reference only, never copy verbatim):

*Pottery/ceramics:*
- "the way that glaze caught the light is beautiful. what cone did you fire to?"
- "this is incredible for your first year throwing, the centering is so clean"
- "love the shape on this. the proportions are really satisfying"

*Coffee/lifestyle:*
- "that setup is goals. do you notice a difference with the ceramic vs glass pour over?"
- "nothing beats a slow morning with a good cup"
- "this is making me rethink my whole morning routine"

*DIY/craft:*
- "this came out so well. what brand of clay are you using?"
- "the detail work on this is really impressive"
- "love seeing the process, not just the finished piece"

*Group-specific comments:*
- "love seeing everyone's progress in here. that rim is getting so much cleaner"
- "this is exactly why i joined this group, such great work"
- "great question, i've been wondering the same thing"

When commenting in Groups, you can reference the group context (e.g., "love seeing this kind of work in this group"). This feels natural because Groups are communities, and referencing the community builds belonging.

## Facebook Reaction Selection Guide

When reacting to posts on Facebook, choose the reaction that matches the content:

| Reaction | When to Use | Target Frequency |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Like** (thumbs up) | Safe default for any post. Use when content is good but doesn't evoke strong emotion. | ~50% of reactions |
| **Love** (heart) | Beautiful finished pieces, stunning photos, aesthetic setups, inspiring work, "perfect" moments. | ~40% of reactions |
| **Care** (hug) | Personal stories of struggle or growth, someone sharing their first piece, emotional milestones, vulnerable posts. | ~10% of reactions |

**Never use:** Haha (can seem mocking), Wow (can seem sarcastic), Sad, Angry. These are too risky coming from a brand Page -- they're easily misinterpreted.

If you're unsure which reaction to use, default to **Like**. It's always safe.

## Adapting to Brand Context

The examples above are illustrative and lean toward pottery/ceramics/coffee themes. When a different brand context is loaded:

1. Read the brand context file to understand the brand's content themes, target customers, and voice
2. Adapt comment topics to match the brand's niche (e.g., a fitness brand would comment on workout posts, not pottery)
3. Match the brand voice description -- a playful brand sounds different from a refined brand
4. Keep the same structural rules (length, distribution, hard rules) regardless of brand
5. The comment should sound like a real person who works at/runs the brand, naturally engaging with content they genuinely care about
