# TikTok Workflow

This reference covers the full TikTok engagement workflow: discovery, engagement actions, pacing, and safety. TikTok is video-first, so comments should reference what you saw or heard, not static images.

## Discovery: For You Page (FYP)

The FYP is the primary discovery method. It surfaces fresh, relevant content every session and gives natural variety without searching.

### How to Browse

1. Open TikTok and land on the **For You** feed (default view)
2. Scroll through videos looking for content that matches the brand's audience
3. When you spot relevant content, engage directly — like, follow, comment right from the video
4. Before following, cross-check the creator's handle against the **engagement log** to avoid re-engaging

### Additional Discovery Methods (mix in occasionally)

- **Discover tab:** Browse trending hashtags and sounds in the brand's niche
- **Search:** Look for keywords matching the brand's content themes (e.g., "pottery", "ceramic mug", "pour over coffee", "handmade crafts"). Vary search terms across sessions.
- **Suggested accounts:** When on a relevant creator's profile, check suggested accounts (arrow icon near Follow button)
- **Comment sections:** People leaving substantive comments on niche videos are often good engagement targets

Most sessions should lean on the FYP. Mix in others for variety.

## What to Engage With

Engage with videos that feel like they belong in the brand's world. For Table Clay, that means content like:

- Pottery, ceramics, clay work (throwing, glazing, kiln reveals, handbuilding)
- Coffee culture (pour-overs, latte art, morning routines, cafe visits)
- Cute home finds, aesthetic kitchen/table setups
- DIY and artsy projects (painting, crafting, woodworking, candle making)
- Handmade goods and small business showcases
- Cozy lifestyle and mindful living content
- Process and tutorial videos for crafts

**The bar is vibes, not metrics.** If the video feels like something the brand's audience would enjoy, engage with it.

### What to Skip

- Obvious bot/spam/repost-only accounts
- Content in completely unrelated niches
- Big brand ads or massive creator promo content
- Private accounts
- Accounts already in the engagement log for TikTok

### Soft Guideline on Size

Don't waste time checking follower counts. But if it's obviously a massive creator (100K+ followers visible at a glance, or a well-known name), skip it — they won't notice the engagement. If you can't tell, don't worry about it.

## Engagement Actions

Engage **directly from the video in the FYP** — no need to visit the creator's profile to evaluate them first. If the content vibes, engage.

1. **Follow the creator** — click Follow right from the video
2. **Like (heart) the video** — tap the heart
3. **For 4 of the creators:** Leave a genuine comment (see `references/comment-guide.md`)

Follow + like is the baseline. Comments are reserved for videos where you have something genuinely specific to say about what you saw or heard. Don't force comments.

No saves/bookmarks, no shares, no duets or stitches — those are content creation, not engagement.

## Session Limits

Conservative limits. TikTok is aggressive about bot detection.

| Action | Per Session | Daily Max (2 sessions) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Follows | 10 | 20 |
| Likes | 12 | 24 |
| Comments | 4 | 8 |

**Max 2 sessions per day** (morning + evening).

For accounts running TikTok engagement for 2+ weeks without flags, the user could consider gradually increasing to 12 follows per session. But this should be a manual user decision, not automatic.

---

## Pacing

- **45-90 seconds** between follows
- **20-40 seconds** between likes
- **2-3 minutes** between comments
- When doing multiple actions on a single video (follow + like + comment), space by **15-30 seconds**

### Watch Before Engaging

**Critical for TikTok:** Always watch at least **10-15 seconds** of a video before engaging. TikTok tracks watch time as a signal. An account that follows/likes/comments without watching is a strong bot indicator.

Let the video play, then engage. This adds natural time and makes behavior organic.

### Pattern Variation

Mix it up:
- Sometimes like first, then follow
- Sometimes follow only (no like)
- Vary which creators get comments
- Occasionally like 2-3 of a creator's videos instead of just 1
- Sometimes just watch and scroll past — not every relevant video needs an action

## Safety and Stop Triggers

If you encounter **ANY** of these, **stop immediately** and inform the user:

- "You're tapping too fast" or any rate-limiting message
- CAPTCHA or verification request
- Phone number verification
- "This account was banned" or any restriction notice
- "Your comment couldn't be posted" on repeated attempts
- Unusual loading times or repeated errors
- Being logged out unexpectedly
- Any message about suspicious activity or community guidelines

### Shadowban Awareness

TikTok may shadowban without notification — videos get near-zero views, content doesn't appear in searches. If the user reports this: pause all TikTok engagement for **48-72 hours**.

### Cool-Down Protocols

- **After being flagged:** 6-12 hours minimum
- **Flagged twice in one day:** Skip the rest of the day
- **Suspected shadowban:** 48-72 hours
- **After a temp ban lifts:** Half limits for first 2 sessions back

TikTok penalties escalate fast: rate-limit → temp block → temp ban → permanent ban. Conservative limits matter.

## URL Structure

- **Creator profiles:** `https://www.tiktok.com/@username`
- **Videos:** `https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/[video_id]`

Log clean URLs without tracking parameters.

## Time Per Session

15-25 minutes. Pacing + watch-time requirements spread actions naturally. Don't rush.
