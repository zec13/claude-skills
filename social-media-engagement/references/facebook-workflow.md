# Facebook Workflow

This reference covers the full Facebook engagement workflow. All actions are performed as a **Business Page** (not a personal profile). Discovery and engagement happen exclusively through **Facebook Reels**.

---

## Discovery: Facebook Reels

### How to Access

1. Navigate to `https://www.facebook.com/reel/` or click the **Reels** icon in the left sidebar / bottom nav
2. Facebook loads a vertical Reels feed with auto-playing short videos
3. Scroll through looking for content that matches the brand's audience

### What to Engage With

Engage with Reels that feel like they belong in the brand's world. For Table Clay, that means content like:

- Pottery, ceramics, clay work (throwing, glazing, kiln reveals, handbuilding)
- Coffee culture (pour-overs, latte art, morning routines, cafe visits)
- Cute home finds, aesthetic kitchen/table setups
- DIY and artsy projects (painting, crafting, woodworking, candle making)
- Handmade goods and small business showcases
- Cozy lifestyle and mindful living content

**The bar is vibes, not metrics.** If the content feels like something the brand's audience would enjoy, engage with it.

### What to Skip

- Viral memes, news, celebrity gossip, political content
- Big corporate brand ads
- Content with zero connection to the brand's niche
- Accounts you've already engaged with (check the engagement log)

### Soft Guideline on Size

Don't waste time checking follower counts. But if it's obviously a massive account (100K+ followers visible at a glance, or a well-known brand), skip it — they won't notice the engagement. If you can't tell, don't worry about it.

## Engagement Actions

Engage **directly from the Reel** — no need to visit the creator's profile first. Just react, follow, and (selectively) comment right there.

### 1. React to the Reel

Use contextually appropriate reactions:

| Reaction | When to Use | Frequency |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Like** (thumbs up) | Safe default for any Reel | ~50% of reactions |
| **Love** (heart) | Beautiful visuals, inspiring work, aesthetic content | ~40% of reactions |
| **Care** (hug) | Personal stories, milestones, vulnerable posts | ~10% of reactions |

**Never use:** Haha, Wow, Sad, or Angry — too easy to misread coming from a brand Page.

### 2. Follow the Creator's Page

- Click **Follow** on the creator's name/Page link shown on the Reel overlay
- If the follow button isn't visible on the Reel, skip the follow and just react — don't navigate away to find it
- Only follow Pages, not personal profiles (Business Pages can't send friend requests)

### 3. Comment (selectively)

- **4 comments per session max** (see `references/comment-guide.md`)
- Comment on Reels where you have something specific to say about what you SAW in the video
- Since these are videos, reference the content — a technique, a transformation, a satisfying moment
- Don't comment on every Reel you react to

---

## Session Flow

1. **Navigate** to Facebook Reels
2. **Scroll** through the feed
3. **Engage** when you see relevant content — react, follow, and selectively comment right from the Reel
4. **Keep scrolling** until session limits are reached
5. Vary the depth: some Reels get just a reaction, some get a reaction + follow, some get reaction + follow + comment

---

## Session Limits

| Action | Per Session | Daily Max (2 sessions) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Page follows | 8 | 16 |
| Reactions | 12 | 24 |
| Comments | 4 | 8 |

**Max 2 sessions per day.** Space sessions at least 4 hours apart.

---

## Pacing

- **45-90 seconds** between Page follows
- **20-40 seconds** between reactions
- **1-3 minutes** between comments
- When doing multiple actions on a single Reel (react + follow + comment), space by **15-30 seconds**
- **Watch each Reel for at least 3-5 seconds** before engaging or scrolling past

---

## Safety and Stop Triggers

If you encounter **ANY** of these, **stop immediately** and inform the user:

- "This Feature is Temporarily Unavailable"
- "You're Going Too Fast" or "Slow Down"
- Account checkpoint or identity verification
- CAPTCHA
- "Your Account Has Been Restricted"
- Phone number verification
- "Something Went Wrong" on repeated actions
- Unexpected redirect to a help/support page
- Being logged out unexpectedly

**Cool-down if flagged:** 6-12 hours minimum. Facebook penalties escalate aggressively — a Business Page restriction can last 7-30 days.

---

## URL Structure

- **Pages:** `https://www.facebook.com/[pagename]`
- **Reels:** `https://www.facebook.com/reel/[reel_id]`

---

## Time Per Session

15-25 minutes. The pacing rules spread actions naturally. Don't rush.
