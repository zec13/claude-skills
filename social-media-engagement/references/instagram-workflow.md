# Instagram Workflow

This reference covers the full Instagram engagement workflow: discovery, engagement actions, pacing, and safety.

## Discovery via Explore Tab

**Use the Explore tab** (compass icon in the sidebar), NOT the Search bar. The Explore page surfaces fresh, algorithmically relevant content every time, which means natural variety across sessions without repeating the same accounts. Searching by hashtag/name brings up the same results repeatedly and looks less organic.

### How to Browse Explore

1. Click the **Explore** icon (compass) in the left sidebar
2. Scroll through the grid and look for posts related to the brand's audience
3. When you spot relevant content, engage with it directly — like, follow, comment right from the post
4. Before following, cross-check the account handle against the **engagement log** to avoid re-following

### Additional Discovery Methods (mix in occasionally)

- **Suggested accounts:** When visiting a relevant profile, Instagram shows "Suggested for you" below the bio. These are great leads because they're algorithmically related.
- **Commenters on relevant posts:** People leaving thoughtful comments on niche content are often ideal accounts to engage with.
- **Competitor followers:** Occasionally browse who's commenting on competitor accounts (listed in the brand context file).

Vary which discovery method is primary each session. Most sessions should lean on Explore, but mix in the others for variety.

## What to Engage With

Engage with posts that feel like they belong in the brand's world. For Table Clay, that means content like:

- Pottery, ceramics, clay work (throwing, glazing, kiln reveals, handbuilding)
- Coffee culture (pour-overs, latte art, morning routines, cafe visits)
- Cute home finds, aesthetic kitchen/table setups
- DIY and artsy projects (painting, crafting, woodworking, candle making)
- Handmade goods and small business showcases
- Cozy lifestyle and mindful living content
- Family/kids doing creative activities

**The bar is vibes, not metrics.** If the content feels like something the brand's audience would enjoy, engage with it.

### What to Skip

- Obvious bot/spam accounts
- Content in completely unrelated niches (finance, fitness, politics, etc.)
- Big corporate brand ads or massive influencer promo posts
- Private accounts (can't see their content)
- Accounts already in the engagement log for Instagram

### Soft Guideline on Size

Don't waste time checking follower counts. But if it's obviously a massive account (100K+ followers visible at a glance, or a well-known brand/influencer), skip it — they won't notice the engagement. If you can't tell, don't worry about it.

## Engagement Actions

Engage **directly from the post in Explore** — no need to visit the creator's profile to evaluate them first. If the content is relevant, engage.

1. **Follow the account** — click Follow right from the post
2. **Like their post** — double-tap or click the heart
3. **For 5 of the accounts:** Leave a genuine comment (see `references/comment-guide.md`)

Follow + like is the baseline. Comments are reserved for posts where you have something genuinely specific to say. Don't force comments on posts that don't inspire a natural reaction.

## Session Limits

These limits are non-negotiable. Never exceed them in a single session.

| Action | Per Session | Daily Max (2 sessions) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Follows | 15 | 30 |
| Likes | 15 | 30 |
| Comments | 5 | 10 |

**Max 2 sessions per day** (morning + evening).

---

## Pacing

Space out engagement to mimic natural behavior:

- **30-60 seconds** between follows
- **15-30 seconds** between likes
- **1-2 minutes** between comments
- If anything feels "off" (slow loading, repeated errors, unusual prompts), stop and tell the user

### Pattern Variation

Don't follow, like, comment in the exact same order every time. Mix it up:
- Sometimes like first, then follow
- Sometimes follow only (no like)
- Vary which accounts get comments (not always the first 5 or last 5)
- Occasionally scroll through a profile's recent posts and like 2-3 instead of just 1

The goal is to look like a real person casually browsing and engaging, not a bot executing a script.

## Safety and Stop Triggers

If you encounter ANY of these, **stop immediately** and inform the user:

- "Action Blocked" message
- CAPTCHA or phone verification
- Unusual loading times or repeated errors
- "Try Again Later" message
- Any warning about suspicious activity
- Being logged out unexpectedly

**Cool-down if flagged:** 4-6 hours minimum. Flagged twice in one day — skip the rest of the day entirely.

---

## Time Per Session

15-20 minutes. The pacing rules spread the session naturally. Don't rush.
