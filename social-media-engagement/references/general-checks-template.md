# General Checks Template

This is the EXACT standard General Checks content used across all test plan documents. Use this wording verbatim. Do NOT rewrite, paraphrase, or "improve" this text — it is standardized and testers are trained on this exact language.

## Standard General Checks — Copy This Exactly

The heading should be: "General Checks (all)" in Heading 1 style.

### CRITICAL — Use NUMBERED LIST FORMAT

Each main item is a **numbered bullet** (1., 2., 3., ... 12.) using Word's decimal numbering. Do NOT use bullet characters (•) — use numbers (1., 2., 3., ...).

Item 11 has sub-items using **lettered sub-bullets** (a., b., c., d.) indented one level deeper.

### Items (numbered 1-12):

1. Ensure that instructions and question types are easy to understand and intuitive to use
2. Test that single selects, multi selects, and "select up to specified number" questions are working properly
3. Check to make sure each question specifies '*select all that apply*, *select one*', or other relevant instructions
4. Check that responses are randomized or not randomized, as indicated in the programming notes
5. Make sure that a space is provided for all questions with an "Other. Please specify." response option and can enter text or numbers there (whichever makes sense for that specific question)
6. Make sure response options are anchored/mutually exclusive (for example: "none of the above" responses), as indicated in the programming notes
7. Make sure text responses demand text, and numerical responses demand numbers.
8. Make sure you must select a response for each question and that you can't skip pages
9. Make sure all questions and corresponding answer options have been programmed
10. Make sure new screens are shown where dictated
11. Put yourself in respondent's shoes and think about:
    a. Overall, do question formats clearly reflect how to answer the questions?
    b. Is it difficult to scroll through all answer options for any of the questions?
    c. Is a particular question frustrating to answer? Why?
    d. Is survey easy to take and intuitive to use?
12. Make sure that all pictures/logos are shown in an easy to see way

## Notes

- The sub-bullets under "Put yourself in respondent's shoes" use LETTERED format (a., b., c., d.) at indent level 1
- This section uses NUMBERED formatting (1., 2., ...), NOT bullet characters (•)
- Do NOT add additional items unless the survey has truly unusual requirements (e.g., video playback, external tool integration)
- Do NOT remove items from this list
- Do NOT rephrase or "improve" the wording — this exact language is the standard
- Do NOT use [ ] checkboxes — use the numbered list format
