# Seurat Consulting Prompt Bank

Prompt templates for Seurat Group consulting workflows. Tell me which prompt to run (by number or name) and provide the inputs.

## Survey Design

- **5A. Survey Deep Dive Assistant** — Build out a section of a quantitative survey from a wireframe and example. Outputs: fully programmed survey questions with scales, logic, routing, and base definitions. Provide: wireframe section, past survey example for format reference, any discovery/inputs deck for context.

- **5B. Survey Soft Launch Testing SOP** — Run soft launch QC before full field. Outputs: checklist of what to check at 10-20% fill, quota tracking template, bot/AI detection flags, completion time benchmarks. Provide: survey link, target completes, quota structure.

## Meeting Notes

- **6A. Fieldwork Notes Cleanup** — Turn messy call notes + transcript into a structured deliverable. Outputs: organized notes with key takeaways, verbatim quotes, action items, and follow-ups. Provide: raw transcript, any personal jotted notes, meeting context.

## Weekly Team Emails

- **7A. Weekly Kickoff Email** — Write the Monday team alignment email. Outputs: formatted email with priorities, status updates, asks, and timeline. Provide: this week's priorities, any blockers, updates from last week.

## How to Use

1. Tell me which prompt to run (by number or name)
2. Provide the inputs (I'll ask for anything missing)
3. I'll execute and deliver

**Tips**: Pair with other Seurat skills — use the cpg-consulting-copilot for formatting guidance and the qc-cookbook for any quant checks embedded in the workflow.
