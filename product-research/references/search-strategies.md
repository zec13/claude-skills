## Data Organization During Research

As you research, organize findings into these running lists:

1. **Quotes bank**: Every strong quote with source, star rating, theme tag
2. **Competitor table**: Building the comparison table row by row
3. **Objection list**: Every concern mentioned, with frequency count
4. **Motivation list**: Every buying reason mentioned, with frequency count
5. **Language patterns**: Recurring phrases, metaphors, comparisons customers use
6. **Gaps list**: Things competitors don't address that customers want
7. **Surprise insights**: Unexpected findings that could become positioning angles

This pre-organization makes synthesis into the final dossier much faster and ensures nothing gets lost between research and writing.

## When Web Research Hits Limits

Sometimes web research won't yield enough data. Common scenarios:

**Very new products (no reviews yet)**:
- Research the closest alternative products instead
- Mine forums for the underlying need/desire
- Look at Kickstarter/Indiegogo campaigns in the same category — backer comments are rich with motivations and objections
- Note the gap in research and recommend primary research (surveys, interviews)

**Very niche products (small market)**:
- Go deeper on fewer sources rather than wider
- Facebook groups and niche forums become more valuable
- Expert/enthusiast blogs may have detailed reviews
- LinkedIn discussions for B2B niche products

**Products in regulated industries (health, finance)**:
- Be careful to distinguish marketing claims from validated claims
- Note regulatory constraints in the dossier
- Focus on emotional/experiential VoC rather than efficacy claims
- Flag any claims that would need substantiation

**Products with mostly fake/incentivized reviews**:
- Filter aggressively for "Verified Purchase"
- Weight Reddit and forum feedback more heavily
- Look for video reviews (harder to fake)
- Note the review quality issue in the dossier — it's a market signal itself
