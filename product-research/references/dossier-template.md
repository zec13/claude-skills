## Section 1: Executive Summary

   - **Market Trend**: [key market insight]

   - **Top Objection**: [most common concern and how to address it]

## Section 2: Top 25 Copy-Ready Quotes

**Heading**: `Top 25 Copy-Ready Quotes (Verbatim with Sources)`
**Length**: 800-1200 words
**Content type**: Numbered quote list with citations

**Purpose**: These are the 25 most powerful, copy-ready customer quotes found during research. They can be dropped directly into sales pages, ads, emails, and social media.

**Structure**:
1. Intro paragraph explaining what these quotes are and how to use them
2. 25 numbered quotes, each formatted as:
   ```
   [Number]. "[Exact quote text]" — [Source] ([Context: e.g., "5★ Amazon review", "Reddit r/pottery", "TikTok comment"])
   ```
3. Brief closing note on quote usage rights/attribution

**Selection criteria for quotes**:
- Emotionally vivid (conveys feeling, not just fact)
- Specific (mentions concrete details, not vague praise)
- Addresses a key motivation or overcomes a key objection
- Natural-sounding (reads like a real person, not marketing copy)

- Think broadly — include indirect alternatives (e.g., for a pottery wheel: craft kits, classes, therapy apps, experience gifts)

### Needs vs. Categories Mapping
- List 5-7 core customer needs/jobs-to-be-done
- For each need: which categories serve it, how well, and where gaps exist

### What Competitors Do Well
- 4-6 bullet paragraphs identifying genuine competitive strengths
- Be fair and specific — "Sculpd has excellent unboxing UGC" not "competitors are good at marketing"
