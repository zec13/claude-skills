# Research Methodology — Deep Dive Guide

This reference file provides detailed guidance on conducting each phase of product research. Read this when you need to go deeper on any research step.

## Core Philosophy

**The market tells you what they want to hear.** Effective product research is listening at scale — mining the exact words, emotions, and objections that real customers express, then organizing that raw material into a strategic framework.

This means:
- Never guess what customers care about — find evidence
- Never paraphrase when you can quote — customer language IS the copy
- Never assume an objection is minor — if it shows up in reviews, it's blocking sales
- Never settle for "everyone" as a target — real personas emerge from real patterns

---

## Phase 1: Market Landscape Research

### Goal
Understand where the product sits in the broader market — what categories it competes in, what alternatives exist, and what macro trends affect demand.

### How to Research

**Search queries to run:**
- `[product type] market trends [current year]`
- `[product category] alternatives`
- `best [product type] [current year]`
- `[product type] vs [alternative type]`
- `[product category] industry report`

**What to capture:**
1. **Product categories** (5-8): Don't just list the obvious category. A mini pottery wheel competes with craft kits, art classes, therapy tools, experience gifts, and screen-free activities. Think about what job the customer is hiring this product to do.

2. **Market trends**: Is this category growing? What's driving growth? (e.g., "DIY crafts grew 35% during COVID and sustained 20% growth post-pandemic")

3. **Price ranges**: What do alternatives cost? Map the low-end, mid-range, and premium price points.

4. **Distribution channels**: Where do customers discover and buy these products? Amazon, DTC sites, retail stores, social media?

### Output
A categorized map showing 5-8 product categories, key players in each, price ranges, and how the product under research relates to each category.

## Phase 2: Competitive Analysis

### Goal
Understand what competitors do well, where they fall short, and where positioning gaps exist.

### How to Research

**For each competitor (target 8-12), capture:**

| Data Point | Where to Find It |
|------------|-----------------|
| Product name & price | Their website, Amazon listing |
| Bundle contents | Product page, "what's included" |
| Core positioning | Homepage headline, tagline |
| Key claims | Product page, ads |
| Strengths | High-star reviews, social media praise |
| Weaknesses | Low-star reviews, complaints |
| Visual identity | Website, packaging, social media |
| Ad strategy | Meta Ad Library, TikTok Creative Center |

**Search queries:**
- `[competitor name] review`
- `[competitor name] reddit`
- `[competitor name] vs [other competitor]`
- `site:amazon.com [competitor product name]`

### Competitor Types to Include

1. **Direct competitors** (same product type, same target market): 4-6
2. **Indirect competitors** (different product, same customer need): 2-3
3. **Aspirational competitors** (premium/established brands in adjacent space): 1-2

### Analysis Framework

For the narrative section after the table, organize findings into:

**What competitors do well** (be honest and specific):
- Complete bundles that remove "what else do I need?" friction
- Strong UGC and social proof
- Clear beginner-friendly messaging
- Emotional benefit positioning (stress relief, bonding, etc.)

**Where gaps exist** (these become positioning opportunities):
- No one addresses [specific concern] directly
- Most competitors ignore [customer segment]
- Pricing leaves a gap at [price point]
- No competitor has strong [proof type: e.g., video tutorials, expert endorsements]
- Most competitors use [weak positioning] — stronger alternative exists

---

## Phase 3: Voice of Customer Mining

### Goal
Extract the exact language, motivations, objections, and emotional drivers from real customer discussions. This is the highest-value research phase.

### Where to Mine

**Amazon Reviews** (highest volume, most structured):
- Search for the product and close competitors
- Read both 5-star AND 1-3 star reviews
- 5-star reviews reveal: motivations, use cases, emotional benefits, pleasant surprises
- 1-3 star reviews reveal: objections, disappointments, unmet expectations, comparison points
- Look for "Verified Purchase" reviews for credibility
- Pay attention to review photos — they show real usage context

**Reddit** (most honest, most detailed):
- Search: `[product type] site:reddit.com`
- Check relevant subreddits (e.g., r/pottery, r/crafts, r/giftideas)
- Reddit users explain their reasoning in detail — gold for understanding psychology
- Upvoted comments indicate shared sentiment

**TikTok** (trend signals, younger demographics):
- Search for product type, competitor names, related hashtags
- Read comments on popular videos — they reveal authentic reactions
- Note what content goes viral — it signals what resonates emotionally
- Track: "I need this", "where do I buy this", "does it actually work?"

**YouTube** (detailed reviews, long-form feedback):
- Search for product reviews, unboxings, tutorials
- Read comments for authentic reactions
- Pay attention to: view counts (interest level), like/dislike ratio (sentiment), comment themes

**Forums & Communities** (niche depth):
- Search for product-specific forums or Facebook groups
- These have the most passionate users who provide detailed feedback
- Look for recurring questions — they indicate common information gaps

### What to Extract

For every source, pull:

1. **Verbatim quotes** — exact words in quotation marks with source attribution
2. **Motivation category** — why did they buy/want this? Tag each quote.
3. **Objection category** — what concerned them? Tag each quote.
4. **Emotional state** — how do they feel about the problem and the solution?
5. **Language patterns** — recurring phrases, metaphors, comparisons they use

### Quote Quality Checklist

A good quote for the dossier:
- ✅ Uses specific, concrete language (not vague)
- ✅ Conveys emotion (excitement, relief, frustration, surprise)
- ✅ Could be used directly in copy (reads naturally)
- ✅ Represents a common sentiment (not a one-off)
- ✅ Has clear source attribution

A bad quote:
- ❌ Generic praise ("Great product, highly recommend!")
- ❌ Too short to convey meaning ("Love it")
- ❌ Contains typos/grammar that makes it unclear
- ❌ About shipping/packaging, not the product experience
- ❌ Clearly fake or incentivized

### Organizing VoC Data

Group findings into two buckets:

**Motivations** (why they buy):
- Common categories: stress relief, creative outlet, family bonding, gift giving, skill building, novelty/trend, screen-free activity, self-care, social activity
- Rank by frequency — which motivations appear most often?

**Objections** (what holds them back):
- Common categories: quality concerns, price sensitivity, mess/cleanup, difficulty, durability, completeness of kit, noise, results quality, long-term use
- Rank by severity — which objections kill the most sales?

---

## Phase 4: Objection Deep Dive

### Goal
Turn every identified objection into a structured, rebuttable argument with specific copy and placement recommendations.

### The Objection Kill Sheet Framework

For each objection, develop:

**1. The objection statement**
Write it in the customer's voice, in quotation marks. Use the actual language from VoC mining.

**2. Root cause analysis**
Why do customers have this concern? What experience, assumption, or competitor failure drives it? Understanding the cause determines the rebuttal approach.

Causes typically fall into:
- **Experience-based**: They've been burned before by similar products
- **Assumption-based**: They assume this product has the same limitations as others
- **Information gap**: They can't find the answer on the current sales page
- **Social proof gap**: No one they trust has validated this claim
- **Price-value disconnect**: The price doesn't match their perceived value

**3. Rebuttal strategy**
How to neutralize this objection. Strategies include:
- **Direct proof**: Show evidence (photos, videos, data, certifications)
- **Social proof**: Customer testimonials, UGC, expert endorsements
- **Comparison**: Show how this product specifically addresses the concern vs. alternatives
- **Reframing**: Change how the customer thinks about the issue
- **Guarantee/risk reversal**: Remove the downside risk
- **Education**: Explain why the concern doesn't apply (with evidence)

**4. Microcopy**
1-2 lines of actual copy that could appear on a sales page. This should feel natural, not defensive. The best microcopy addresses the objection without calling attention to it.

**5. Placement recommendation**
Where in the funnel should this objection be addressed?
- **Above the fold**: Only for the #1 most common objection
- **Product features section**: For quality, functionality, completeness concerns
- **Social proof section**: For credibility, results, satisfaction concerns
- **FAQ section**: For practical questions (noise, size, refills, etc.)
- **Retargeting ads**: For price, value, and "do I really need this?" objections
- **Cart abandonment email**: For last-minute anxiety (shipping, returns, guarantees)
- **Post-purchase email**: For usage concerns (setup, difficulty, best practices)

## Phase 5: Persona Development

### Goal
Identify 3-7 distinct buyer personas based on VoC patterns, not demographics alone.

### How Personas Emerge from Research

Don't start with demographics and work backward. Start with **motivations** and let personas emerge naturally:

1. Look at your motivation categories from VoC mining
2. Notice which motivations cluster together (e.g., "stress relief" + "self-care" + "screen-free time" = one persona type)
3. Notice which objections correlate with which motivations
4. Build personas around these motivation/objection clusters
5. THEN add demographics that typically match each cluster

### Persona Template

For each persona, develop:

**Demographics & Context**
- Age range, gender skew, location type (urban/suburban)
- Income range, profession types
- Identity markers (how they see themselves)
- Life stage (new parent, empty nester, career-focused, etc.)

**Pain Points** (3 major ones)
- Specific frustrations they experience
- How these manifest in daily life
- What they've tried before to solve them

**Goals** (short-term and long-term)
- What outcome they want from this product
- What broader life goal this connects to

**Emotional Drivers**
- What feelings motivate them (relief, pride, connection, accomplishment)
- What feelings they want to avoid (guilt, boredom, stress, wastefulness)
- What "transformation" they're seeking

**Key Objections** (specific to this persona)
- Their top 2-3 concerns, ranked
- What proof would overcome each one

**Quotes** (2-3 per persona)
- Direct quotes from VoC that sound like this persona
- These quotes should capture their voice and mindset

**Emotional Journey**
Map the path from awareness to purchase:
1. **Awareness**: What triggers their search? What event or feeling starts the journey?
2. **Consideration**: What do they compare? What questions do they ask?
3. **Decision**: What tips them over the edge? What final proof do they need?
4. **Post-purchase**: What determines whether they're satisfied?

---

## Phase 6: Messaging & Ad Angle Development

### Goal
Translate research into actionable messaging frameworks and creative concepts.

### Messaging Hierarchy

Build from the ground up:

**Level 1: Core promise** (one sentence that works for everyone)
- What's the single most compelling thing about this product?
- It should address the #1 motivation AND neutralize the #1 objection

**Level 2: Persona-specific promises** (one per persona)
- Same product, different angle based on what each persona cares about most
- Each should feel like it was written just for them

**Level 3: Supporting bullets** (3-5 per persona)
- Benefit-driven proof points that support the persona-specific promise
- Written as actual copy, ready to drop into a sales page

### Ad Angle Framework

For each ad angle:
1. **Name the angle** — a shorthand that captures the approach
2. **Identify the target persona** — who will this resonate with most?
3. **Write the hook** — the first 3 seconds of attention. What stops the scroll?
4. **Describe the visual** — what does the viewer see? Be specific.
5. **Map the story arc** — hook → tension/curiosity → reveal/proof → CTA
6. **Write the CTA** — what action, and why now?

### Angle Types That Work

- **Curiosity**: "You won't believe what this tiny wheel can do"
- **Problem/Solution**: "Tired of [problem]? This solves it in [timeframe]"
- **Social proof/UGC**: "Watch [person type] try this for the first time"
- **Before/After**: Show the transformation (skill, mood, output)
- **Oddly satisfying**: Visual/ASMR appeal (especially for tactile products)
- **Gift hook**: "Looking for a gift they'll actually use?"
- **Trend/Challenge**: Ride a current trend with the product as the star
- **Expert endorsement**: Authority figure validates the product
- **Comparison**: Show how this beats alternatives (without being negative)
- **Emotional story**: Connect the product to a meaningful life moment
