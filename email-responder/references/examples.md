# Email Examples - Nick Fisher Style

Real examples from Nick's sent emails demonstrating the style guide in action.

## Quick Acknowledgments

### Ultra-casual (close colleague)
```
Thx for taking notes here again 😊
```

### Quick thanks + handoff
```
Thanks Kyra! I really appreciate you helping out with the inputs along with these AI profiles.

Sending this out to the team now. Have a great weekend!
```

### Short progress update
```
Hi Adam,

Awesome, glad Todd is on board as well. Next week I'll dive back into the updates and will keep you posted as I make progress.

Thanks again for your support.

Best,
Nick
```

## Receipt + Action Emails

### Confirming receipt with deliverable
```
Hi Stephen,

Confirming receipt, thanks for sending and for the flexibility around my capacity today.

Sending back the survey document with Q200-212 updated.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
Nick
```

### Receipt with caveats
```
Hi Clara,

Sending along the UNREAL Gummy Candy outline. Flagging that I have yet to take a deep look at the syndicated data, which could help clarify out third SKU to launch.

Aside from that, feeling good about the overall section flow. I wrote out what can go on each slide and also a plain text version of the section story.

Let me know of any questions and thanks for reviewing.

Best,
Nick
```

## Deliverable Emails

### Internal deliverable with flags
```
Hi Clara,

Sending along a draft of the UNREAL follow-ups. Flagging that I have yet to do the cannibalization page and there is a hold on the RHS of the repeat purchase page for UNREAL specific data.

Please reach out any questions. Thanks so much!

Best,
Nick
```

### External client deliverable
```
Hi Ina,

I hope you are well.

Sending back the Henkel Demand Map Pages along with the charts. The charts include the brands with above 100 respondents (plus got2b).

Here is the link to the main deck:
[link]

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
Nick
```

### External deliverable with detailed explanation
```
Hi Stephen,

Hope you're doing well.

Sharing the Henkel survey crosstabs for Mindy. I included a Survey Total tab, plus the tabs you referenced in the email chain. I also spent some time cleaning the tabs according to client-ready-tab best practices, so they should be in good enough shape.

One note: on both the Styling x Brands and Hair Care x Brands sheets, I added a small comment box to clarify the breaks between segments for easier interpretation.

Let me know if you have any questions, and I'm happy to make any additional tweaks.

Best,
Nick
```

## Feedback Response Emails

### Gracious acknowledgment of feedback
```
Hi Clara,

Confirming receipt, thanks so much for the detailed feedback.

I went through the comments and everything makes sense. No need to apologize for the nitpicky formatting notes, I agree client-ready tabs need to be super clean, and I want to make sure UNREAL is fully satisfied with the output.

I'm going to go through in more detail and start actioning the changes later today and will reach out if any questions come up or if I hit anything that feels like a lot of effort for limited payoff.

Thanks again!

Best,
Nick
```

### Detailed feedback response with action plan
```
Hi Ethan,

Thanks so much for the detailed feedback.

We're aligned on organization and will action your notes, then do a quick end-to-end pass to confirm each page is in the right section and that the story flows cleanly through the deck.

We're also aligned on size and will tighten the body down to the most important pages, moving anything else to the appendix or cutting as needed so the deck stays in the 30-40 page range and remains as informative as possible.

We'll address your comments along with the structure and sizing updates first and then turn the summary pages afterward, sending you an updated version by 4:30. Thanks again!

Best,
Nick
```

## Timeline/Capacity Emails

### Capacity management with alternatives
```
Hi Stephen,

Glad that the section is in solid shape!

Today I am packed with UNREAL follow-ups and Merck page building for our KO / Work session next week, but I think I will be able to spare 1-2 hours closer to EOD.

I'm not 100% sure on the desired timeline for this survey document but does that work for you? If not, happy to chat with my project managers to see if there is anything I can deprioritize to free up some more capacity.

Thank you!

Best,
Nick
```

### Detailed weekly timeline
```
Hi Clara,

I hope you had a great weekend!

Confirming receipt, thanks for sending the plan.

I'll start pulling together the data we need to support the story per Jill's comments (focusing on the gummy category), and I'll jump into page building later Tuesday PM, getting you WIP gummy pages by Wednesday EOD.

Then I'll plan to refine the pages Thursday AM ahead of your review Thursday at noon, and I'll hold time Friday to help refine the deck.

Best,
Nick
```

## External Vendor/Partner Emails

### Polite decline with future possibility
```
Hi Jesse,

Hope you are doing well!

Thanks for reaching out – right now we are not in any need for expert calls. However, I am sure that we will be sometime in the near future. I will reach out if anything changes!

Thank you!

Best,
Nick
```

### Managing expectations
```
Hi Bob,

Totally understand, and appreciate the transparency.

We're going to give our current fielding partners one more night and re-check progress tomorrow morning. If we're still short, we may come back to you first thing tomorrow to see if you're able to support.

Thanks again,
Nick
```

### Technical clarification questions
```
Hi Dawson,

Thanks, super helpful.

Quick clarification on the "facts" point: when you say you would automatically include "% chg vs YAGO," is that included for each fact we select (e.g., $ Sales + % chg vs YA, Units + % chg vs YA, Avg Price + % chg vs YA, TDP + % chg vs YA, Velocity + % chg vs YA)?

And to confirm, do those % chg vs YA fields count against the "up to 10 standard facts," or are they included automatically without consuming additional fact slots?

Best,
Nick
```

## Team/Group Emails

### PTO notification
```
Hi team,

Sharing my upcoming February PTO plans.
• February 13th (PM)
• February 23rd - February 25th

I will ensure all workstreams are in a good place before logging off.

Best,
Nick
```

### Team celebration/milestone
```
Hi team,

Excited to share that we are officially out of field and have achieved our overall fill goal! Thank you all for your support throughout this process.

Once we have finished reviewing the final batch of open ends and removed any remaining potential AI-bot responses, we will send over the final data files and an updated quota tracker.

Best,
Nick
```

### Conditional next steps
```
Hi all,

Thanks for looping me in. If we decide to elevate Foresights to a fifth pillar, I'll revisit the homepage layout for this section, test both options, and share a recommendation on which presents the information most cleanly.

Separately, once we have the final copy and asset, adding a simple download link or linked CTA is relatively straightforward.

Best,
Nick
```

## Strategy/Alignment Emails

### Confirming alignment on approach
```
Hi Stephen,

Sounds good! We're aligned with your suggestion to give Forsta another night at the $6 CPC and to treat the Hispanic and got2b minimums as targets rather than hard requirements so we can keep momentum and get out of field.

We'll keep the higher-cost vendor as a last resort and revisit tomorrow if needed. We're also still waiting to hear back from the additional vendor we reached out to and will send an update as soon as we do.

Best,
Nick
```

## Meeting Requests

### Flexible meeting invite
```
Feel free to move if another time works better
```

## Holiday/Seasonal

### Simple holiday greeting
```
Hey Ujjwal,

Happy holidays!

Best,
Nick
```

## Email Chain Replies

These examples show how Nick responds within ongoing email threads.

### Quick Chain Acknowledgment
**Context:** Clara gave her take on a vendor option (EuroMonitor better, current option not going to work out)
```
Hi Clara,

Thanks for the quick response.

Followed up and will keep you updated!

Best,
Nick
```

### Acknowledging + Scheduling
**Context:** Jill raised concerns about whether they actually need a data pull
```
Hi Jill,

That makes sense. I sent over a calendar invite for 11:30 to chat through whether we actually need the pull (and what we'd want out of it).

Let me know if that time doesn't work.

Best,
Nick
```

### Confirming Receipt in Chain
**Context:** Ethan sent BI examples for reference
```
Hi Ethan,

Confirming receipt, thanks for sending this through.

I will use these as a resource as I build the Merck inputs tracker, and I'll reach out if any questions come up.

Best,
Nick
```

### Acknowledging Feedback in Chain
**Context:** Kyra provided feedback on a discovery document
```
Hi Kyra,

Thank you for the feedback.

I have gone through an actioned the comments, everything made sense to me.

Best,
Nick
```

### Following Up with Flexibility (External)
**Context:** Waiting on a vendor to schedule a meeting with their team
```
Hey Vanessa,

Just wanted to follow up and let you know that it is okay if they cannot meet today, but any time tomorrow morning would be incredibly helpful, even if it is last minute notification, don't be afraid to shoot me a call / text.

Here is my number: (518) 369-9956

Best,
Nick
```

### Acknowledging Instructions/Process
**Context:** Maureen explained a payment confirmation process
```
Hi Maureen,

Understood, I will make sure moving forward to always confirm payments even if they are sent directly to you.

Thanks again!

Best,
Nick
```

### Chain Reply with Action + Flexibility
**Context:** Request for lunch order in a group email
```
Hi Maureen,

I hope you are doing well.

Could I please have the crispy rice bowl with chicken? If it doesn't come with chicken, no worries and please sign me up for the Kale Caesar with chicken.

Thank you for organizing this!

Best,
Nick
```

## Key Chain Reply Patterns

### Pattern: Acknowledge → Action → Close
Most chain replies follow this simple structure:
1. Acknowledge what was said/sent
2. State what you did or will do
3. Brief close

### Pattern: Align → Schedule
When discussion needs to move to a call:
1. Affirm the point ("That makes sense")
2. Propose meeting with purpose
3. Offer flexibility on timing

### Pattern: Confirm → Commit
When acknowledging instructions:
1. "Understood" or "Got it"
2. State the commitment going forward
3. Thanks

### When Chains Get Very Short
In rapid back-and-forth, replies can become one-liners:
- "Thanks for the quick response. Followed up and will keep you updated!"
- "Understood, I will make sure moving forward to [do X]."
- "That makes sense. Sent over a calendar invite."
