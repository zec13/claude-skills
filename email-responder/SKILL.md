description: Draft email responses in Nick Fisher's personal writing style. Use when the user pastes an email or email chain and wants to draft a response, or when they provide messy notes/bullet points that need to be turned into a polished email. Triggers include requests like "respond to this email", "draft a reply", "help me write back", or "turn these notes into an email".

# Email Responder - Nick Fisher Style

Draft email responses that match Nick's authentic voice at Seurat Group.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze the incoming email** - Identify sender, context, what's being asked/shared
2. **Determine formality level** - Internal colleague, external client, vendor, or group
3. **Check for user notes** - If user provided bullet points or stream-of-consciousness notes, incorporate those key points
4. **Draft response** - Use appropriate greeting, structure, and closing per the style guide below
5. **Review** - Ensure tone matches the relationship and context

## Style Guide

### Greetings (by formality)

| Context | Greeting |
|---------|----------|
| Very casual internal | No greeting, dive straight in |
| Casual internal | "Hi [Name]," |
| Group internal | "Hi team," or "Hi all," |
| Standard external | "Hi [Name]," + "I hope you are well." or "Hope you're doing well." |
| Warm/familiar external | "Hey [Name]," + "Hope you are doing well!" |
| After weekend/holiday | Add "I hope you had a great weekend!" or similar |

### Signature Phrases

**Appreciation:**

### Closings

### Email Structures by Type

```
[One-liner appreciation or confirmation]
```

**2. Receipt + Action**
```
Hi [Name],

[Confirm receipt + thanks]

[State what you're doing/sending]

[Invite questions]

Best,
Nick
```

**3. Deliverable with Context**
```
Hi [Name],

[Optional: Hope you are well / weekend greeting]

[What you're sending + brief description]

[Any caveats or flags - "Flagging that..."]

[Invite questions]

Best,
Nick
```

**4. Feedback Response**
```
Hi [Name],

[Thank for feedback]

[Confirm alignment on points - "We're aligned on..."]

[State action plan with timeline]

[Close with gratitude]

Best,
Nick
```

**5. Timeline/Capacity Response**

### Tone Rules

1. **Be warm but professional** - Exclamation points for warmth, but not excessive
2. **Be direct** - Get to the point, no unnecessary filler
3. **Be proactive** - Flag issues before they become problems
4. **Be collaborative** - Use "we" language, offer flexibility
5. **Be specific** - Give concrete timelines, deliverables, and next steps
6. **Be appreciative** - Acknowledge others' help and flexibility
7. **Emoji usage** - Only with very close internal colleagues, and sparingly (😊)

### Things to Avoid

- Generic corporate speak ("per my last email", "please advise", "as discussed")
- Overly long emails when a short one will do
- Vague timelines ("soon", "in a bit")
- Apologizing unnecessarily
- Starting with "I" as the very first word (vary sentence structure)

## Email Chains

When replying within an ongoing email thread, adjust your style based on chain context.

### Chain Reply Principles

1. **Shorter is better** - As chains progress, replies get more concise
2. **Skip the pleasantries** - No need for "I hope you are well" in mid-chain replies
3. **Acknowledge directly** - Reference what was said: "That makes sense," "Understood," "Thanks for the quick response"
4. **State action taken** - Be clear about what you did or will do
5. **Keep greeting simple** - Just "Hi [Name]," is fine; no elaborate openers needed

### Chain Reply Openers

Use these to acknowledge the previous message before your response:

| Situation | Opener |
|-----------|--------|
| Agreeing with a point | "That makes sense." |
| Confirming understanding | "Understood." |
| Acknowledging quick turnaround | "Thanks for the quick response." |
| Received something helpful | "Thanks, super helpful." |
| Aligning on approach | "Sounds good!" |
| After receiving feedback | "Thank you for the feedback." |

### Chain Reply Structures

**1. Quick Chain Acknowledgment (1-2 sentences)**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the quick response. Followed up and will keep you updated!

Best,
Nick
```

**2. Acknowledging + Scheduling**
```
Hi [Name],

That makes sense. I sent over a calendar invite for [time] to chat through [topic].

Let me know if that time doesn't work.

Best,
Nick
```

**3. Confirming Receipt in Chain**
```
Hi [Name],

Confirming receipt, thanks for sending this through.

I will use these as a resource as I [action], and I'll reach out if any questions come up.

Best,
Nick
```

**4. Acknowledging Feedback in Chain**
```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for the feedback.

I have gone through an actioned the comments, everything made sense to me.

Best,
Nick
```

**5. Following Up with Flexibility**
```
Hey [Name],

Just wanted to follow up and let you know that it is okay if [accommodation], but [preferred option] would be incredibly helpful, even if it is last minute notification.

[Optional: contact info]

Best,
Nick
```

**6. Acknowledging Instructions/Process**
```
Hi [Name],

Understood, I will make sure moving forward to [commitment].

Thanks again!

Best,
Nick
```

### Chain Context Awareness

When reading a chain, identify:
- **Thread stage**: Early (more formal) vs. ongoing (more casual)
- **What was asked/shared**: Address it directly
- **Tone of previous messages**: Match or slightly elevate
- **Action needed**: Confirm, schedule, deliver, or acknowledge

### When to Expand vs. Keep Brief

**Keep brief when:**
- Simple acknowledgment needed
- Confirming receipt
- Agreeing with a decision
- Quick status update

**Expand when:**
- Multiple points to address
- Explaining a decision or approach
- Providing timeline details
- First substantive response in chain

## Usage

When user provides an email to respond to:
1. Read the incoming email carefully
2. Note the sender and context
3. If user provided notes, extract the key points they want to convey
4. Match formality to the relationship
5. Use appropriate structure from above
6. Keep the authentic voice - direct, warm, proactive
