## Selected Concepts — Top 5

### Concept B6-1: Your First Pot Won't Be Perfect. That's the Point.
- **Type:** Beginner Reframe / Pain Agitation
- **Score:** 23/25 (Emotional: 5, Scroll-Stop: 4, Brand: 5, Differentiation: 5, Feasibility: 4)
- **Funnel Stage:** Consideration
- **Strategic Rationale:** Fear of failure and looking silly is the #1 barrier stopping beginners from purchasing pottery kits. No competitor reframes imperfection as the feature — everyone promises "easy results." This bold reframe disarms the objection and creates instant emotional recognition for the hesitant buyer. Uniquely ownable angle.
- **Ad Copy:** "YOUR FIRST POT WON'T BE PERFECT." (large, charcoal) / "THAT'S THE POINT." (terracotta) / "Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel" (small, sage)
- **File:** Batch6_C1_First_Pot_Not_Perfect.jpg

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Close-up commercial lifestyle photography of a small, endearingly imperfect first pottery piece — a tiny hand-thrown bowl, slightly uneven at the rim, with gentle fingerprint textures pressed into the natural off-white air-dry clay walls. The bowl sits centered on a warm cream (#F5F0E8) linen surface, catching soft warm light from the upper left. The Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel is visible in the soft background — cream-colored, compact tabletop electric model, not a toy, not an industrial wheel — slightly out of focus but recognizable. The bowl occupies the center 40% of the frame, positioned in the lower half of the image, with the top 35% of the image reserved for text. A small wooden pottery tool rests casually beside the bowl. The mood is warm, honest, and encouraging — this is a real beginner's first piece, and it's beautiful because of its imperfection. Warm directional window light from the upper left, creating gentle highlights on the rim and clay walls. Shallow depth of field — bowl is tack-sharp, background wheel and surface fall to a beautiful soft blur. At the very top 35% of the image, large bold condensed sans-serif, deep charcoal (#2D3436), spanning 80% of image width: "YOUR FIRST POT WON'T BE PERFECT." Directly below that, in the same bold condensed sans-serif but in terracotta (#C4826A): "THAT'S THE POINT." At the very bottom center, in small light sans-serif, sage green (#B5C4A1): "Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel". Color palette: cream (#F5F0E8) surface, natural off-white clay, charcoal and terracotta text, sage green footer. Commercial lifestyle photography, premium DTC brand aesthetic, intimate and authentic. Do not include: perfectly smooth factory-made ceramic, kiln equipment, handles on the pot, bright plastic colors on the wheel, industrial-size wheel, multiple products, distorted or misspelled text. --ar 4:5

### Concept B6-2: The Shelf That Started It All.
- **Type:** Lifestyle / Aspirational — Result Showcase
- **Score:** 23/25 (Emotional: 4, Scroll-Stop: 4, Brand: 5, Differentiation: 5, Feasibility: 5)
- **Funnel Stage:** Awareness
- **Strategic Rationale:** No competitor shows the long-term "life after purchase" — the mini pottery pieces living on a shelf, becoming part of the home aesthetic. This concept targets the creative-identity buyer who wants to see themselves as someone who makes beautiful things. The wheel sitting below the shelf shows this has a permanent home, not a junk drawer fate.
- **Ad Copy:** "THE SHELF THAT STARTED IT ALL." (elegant serif, top) / "Table Clay" (small, sage)
- **File:** Batch6_C2_The_Shelf.jpg

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Warm editorial lifestyle photography of a wooden floating wall shelf displaying a curated small collection of handmade mini pottery pieces — three to four tiny items: a small ring dish, a tiny rounded bowl, a mini planter, each in natural air-dry clay tones ranging from off-white to soft terracotta, with subtle fingerprint textures showing they were handmade. The shelf is warm natural light wood, mounted on a soft cream (#F5F0E8) painted wall. Below the shelf, on a small wooden side table, the Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel sits in its home position — cream-colored, compact, cord neatly coiled — as if this corner of the home is its permanent creative studio spot. The room has an earthy, warm, creative-person aesthetic — soft sage green (#B5C4A1) accents in the space, warm morning light streaming gently from a nearby window. A small trailing plant adds life to the corner without cluttering. Soft warm natural window light from the right side, filling the entire scene with a golden morning quality. Slightly elevated camera angle at 20 degrees, medium depth of field — shelf pottery pieces and wheel are sharp, wall and far background fall to a gentle warm blur. At the top 25% of the image, in elegant light serif font, off-white (#FFF8F0): "THE SHELF THAT STARTED IT ALL." At the bottom right, small condensed sans-serif, sage green (#B5C4A1): "Table Clay". Color palette: cream (#F5F0E8) walls, warm wood shelf, natural clay tones, sage green (#B5C4A1) plant accents, off-white text. Premium DTC brand aesthetic, editorial warmth, aspirational home lifestyle. Do not include: toy-like plastic colors on wheel, large industrial pottery wheel, kiln equipment, cluttered or messy shelves, modern factory-made ceramics, distorted or misspelled text. --ar 4:5

### Concept B6-3: When Was The Last Time You Made Something?
- **Type:** Curiosity / Nostalgia Hook
- **Score:** 22/25 (Emotional: 5, Scroll-Stop: 4, Brand: 4, Differentiation: 5, Feasibility: 4)
- **Funnel Stage:** Awareness
- **Strategic Rationale:** Adults who once identified as creative — and lost that outlet — feel a deep, unnamed longing to make things with their hands. This question lands like a gut-punch of recognition for that persona. The open, reflective tone is completely uncontested in the pottery kit category, where every competitor screams "fun!" instead of pausing to connect.
- **Ad Copy:** "When was the last time" / "you made something?" (elegant light serif, off-white) / "Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel" (small, sage)
- **File:** Batch6_C3_When_Did_You_Make.jpg

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Commercial lifestyle photography of a pair of adult hands — showing natural character and warmth, slightly worn and real — pressed gently into fresh off-white air-dry clay centered on a compact electric pottery wheel, caught in a quiet mid-moment of beginning to shape the clay. The hands are relaxed, warm skin tones, dusted lightly with dry white clay on the fingers and knuckles. The wheel is cream (#F5F0E8), compact tabletop model, occupying the lower 50% of the image — the wheel head and clay are the focal point. The background is deep charcoal (#2D3436), clean and dramatic. A warm terracotta clay smudge is visible on the back of the right hand, glowing golden under soft directional studio light from the upper left. The mood is reflective, intimate, and meaningful — an adult quietly reconnecting with the act of making. Warm soft directional light from upper left, highlighting the hands and clay with a gentle golden quality; the wheel and charcoal background fall into rich shadow. At the top 35% of the image, in large elegant light serif, two lines of off-white (#FFF8F0) text: line 1 "When was the last time" — line 2 "you made something?" — both centered, with comfortable breathing room between lines. At the very bottom center, in small condensed sans-serif, sage green (#B5C4A1): "Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel". Slightly elevated camera angle at 25 degrees. Shallow depth of field — hands and clay are tack-sharp, wheel body and background fall to smooth dark blur. Color palette: charcoal (#2D3436) background, warm skin tones, off-white clay, terracotta smudge, off-white and sage green text. Premium DTC brand aesthetic, emotionally resonant editorial photography. Do not include: children's hands, toy-like plastic colors on wheel, large industrial wheel, kiln equipment, multiple products in background, messy uncontrolled clay splatter, distorted or misspelled text. --ar 4:5

### Concept B6-4: This Is What $79 Looks Like.
- **Type:** Value Reveal / Offer Heavy
- **Score:** 23/25 (Emotional: 4, Scroll-Stop: 5, Brand: 5, Differentiation: 4, Feasibility: 5)
- **Funnel Stage:** Conversion
- **Strategic Rationale:** "Is this worth the price?" is an unspoken conversion barrier. Dramatically revealing what $79 buys — visually, in a dramatic starburst arrangement — answers the question before it's asked. The price-reveal headline is provocative and scroll-stopping (people love content that reveals value). No pottery competitor leads with price as a confident reveal.
- **Ad Copy:** "THIS IS WHAT $79 LOOKS LIKE." (massive bold headline, top) / "Everything Included. Nothing to Buy Separately." (small, terracotta)
- **File:** Batch6_C4_This_Is_What_79.jpg

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Dramatic editorial overhead flatlay — styled product value-reveal photography — of the complete Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel Starter Bundle spread dramatically across a deep charcoal (#2D3436) textured surface. Items are arranged in a confident starburst or radiating pattern from the central pottery wheel, creating a visually dramatic reveal composition with breathing space between each item group. The compact cream (#F5F0E8) electric pottery wheel sits in the upper-center as the hero piece. Radiating outward in organized arcs: two packs of natural off-white air-dry clay (each showing weight label), 16 pottery tools fanned elegantly in two curved arcs — thin metal-tipped sculpting tools and small wooden shaping tools — a small tray with 8 earth-tone paints with fine brushes arranged beside it, a folded instruction booklet, and one small finished example ring dish in off-white clay. The overall arrangement reads as deliberate abundance — the viewer immediately understands the value. Charcoal background makes every cream and clay item pop dramatically. Camera directly overhead at 90 degrees (flat-lay), even depth of field — everything sharp from edge to edge. Bright even studio lighting, balanced warm temperature, making all cream items glow. At the top 20% of the image, massive bold condensed sans-serif, off-white (#FFF8F0), spanning 90% of image width: "THIS IS WHAT $79 LOOKS LIKE." At the very bottom center, in small clean sans-serif, terracotta (#C4826A): "Everything Included. Nothing to Buy Separately." Color palette: deep charcoal (#2D3436) background, cream (#F5F0E8) wheel and clay, sage green (#B5C4A1) accents on tools, off-white and terracotta text. Premium DTC brand product-reveal photography. Do not include: missing bundle items, messy or randomly scattered arrangement, toy-like bright colors, kiln equipment, large industrial wheel, distorted or misspelled text, non-bundle items. --ar 4:5

### Concept B6-5: Self-Care Looked Different Before This.
- **Type:** Self-Gift / Lifestyle
- **Score:** 22/25 (Emotional: 5, Scroll-Stop: 4, Brand: 5, Differentiation: 4, Feasibility: 4)
- **Funnel Stage:** Awareness / Consideration
- **Strategic Rationale:** "Treating yourself" is a powerful and underserved purchase frame for the pottery kit category — everyone markets to gift-givers or parents, but not to women buying something meaningful just for themselves. This warm self-care lifestyle image positions Table Clay as the creative ritual that replaces the spa day, the bath bomb, the scroll session — something that actually gives back.
- **Ad Copy:** "SELF-CARE LOOKED DIFFERENT BEFORE THIS." (large elegant serif, cream) / "Table Clay" (small, sage)
- **File:** Batch6_C5_Self_Care.jpg

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Warm editorial lifestyle photography of a woman — visible from the shoulders and collarbone down only, no face shown — wearing an oversized cream knit sweater, sitting at a cozy wooden kitchen table with her hands gently shaping clay on a compact electric pottery wheel. The wheel is cream (#F5F0E8), modern and compact, placed on the warm wooden table. A small finished clay ring dish sits to the side, just completed. The scene radiates warmth and indulgence: in the soft-focus background, a large steaming mug of tea and a small lit candle create a golden blur of comfort. Warm late-afternoon window light streams from the left, casting the entire scene in golden hour warmth. The vibe is pure "treat yourself" — this is her time, her creative ritual, her version of self-care that actually feels fulfilling. Warm directional natural light from the left window, casting golden highlights across her hands, the clay, and the cream wheel, with rich warm shadow on the right. Slightly elevated camera angle, 20 degrees, medium-shallow depth of field — hands, clay, and wheel tack-sharp; mug, candle, and background fall to a beautiful warm blur. At the top 30% of the image, in large elegant slightly condensed serif, cream white (#FFF8F0): "SELF-CARE LOOKED DIFFERENT BEFORE THIS." At the very bottom right, in small light sans-serif, sage green (#B5C4A1): "Table Clay". Color palette: warm cream (#F5F0E8) and golden throughout, terracotta (#C4826A) accent warmth in lighting, charcoal (#2D3436) as deep shadow, sage green text. Premium DTC lifestyle brand aesthetic, warm self-care editorial mood. Do not include: visible face, bright or plastic colors on wheel, large industrial wheel, kiln equipment, multiple people, messy clay splatter, visible screens or digital devices, distorted or misspelled text. --ar 4:5
