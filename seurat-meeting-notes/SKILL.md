# Seurat Meeting Notes

Transform raw meeting materials into polished, client-ready notes documents.

## Inputs Required

1. **Transcript** - Raw call transcript (required)
2. **Deck/Presentation** - Content being presented (if applicable)
3. **Personal Notes** - User's jotted notes highlighting important points (if available)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Before processing, ensure you have:
- Meeting title/type (e.g., "WSI Demand Spaces & Drivers", "Pre-WSII Alignment")
- Date of meeting
- Attendee names (Seurat team and client team)
- Client company name

If missing, ask the user.

### Step 2: Process Materials

Read all provided materials. Identify:
- **Who said what** - Distinguish Seurat team vs client comments
- **Key decisions/alignments** - What did they agree on?
- **Open questions** - What needs follow-up?
- **Action items** - Who committed to do what?

### Step 3: Extract Content (NOT repeat deck/presentation content)

Critical: Notes capture **what the client said and what emerged from discussion**, not what the Seurat team presented or explained.

**Read `references/content-quality.md` for detailed guidance on what makes content useful.**

Extract:
- Client reactions to presented material
- Questions raised and how addressed (with underlying concerns)
- Agreements reached and rationale
- Concerns or pushback with specific examples
- Follow-up items with concrete deliverables

Apply the "So What" test: Every point should have clear implications for next steps or decisions.

**Content Quality Essentials:**
- **Synthesize** long discussions into consolidated actionable points
- **Capture underlying concerns**, not just surface questions
- **Preserve specific examples** (brand names, benefit language debated)
- **Quote key phrases** that resonated ("center of gravity", "band-aid approach")
- **Include rationale**, not just positions

Do NOT include:
- What the Seurat team presented or explained (definitions, methodology, data walkthrough)
- Facts already in the deck
- Background information or context from the presentation
- Descriptions of what spaces/concepts mean — this is known; capture reactions to them
- Raw data without interpretation
- "We discussed X" without the outcome
- "Team walked through X" or "Team explained X" — instead capture the client response

### Step 4: Generate Document

Use the docx skill to create a Word document. Read `references/format-guide.md` for detailed formatting rules.

#### Document Structure

```
**[Client] [Meeting Type] Notes [Date]**

Seurat Team: [names]
[Client] Team: [names]

**[Next Steps]{.underline}**
- **Team to** [action]
  - [sub-action details]
- **[Client] to** [action]

**[Key Takeaways]{.underline}**
- [Typically 5-8 bullets - adjust to meeting substance; selective bolding, full sentences]

**[Full Notes]{.underline}**
***[Topic 1]***
- [Discussion points with sub-bullets for responses]

***[Topic 2]***
- [Continue chronologically]
```

## Formatting Quick Reference

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Font | Franklin Gothic Book, 11pt throughout |
| Bullet spacing | Tight — no extra space between bullets |
| Section headers | Bold + underline |
| Topic headers (Full Notes) | Bold + italic |
| Action items | `**Name to** action...` |
| Key concepts | Selective bold within bullets |

## Key Principles

1. **Client-centric** - Notes are about what THEY said, asked, decided — not what Seurat presented
2. **Net new only** - Don't repeat deck content or explain what concepts/spaces mean
3. **Concise** - Sub-bullets max 3 lines; Key Takeaway main bullets max ~2 lines
4. **Actionable** - Clear owners for all next steps with specific deliverables
5. **Decisions over details** - Focus on what was AGREED/CHANGED/DECIDED
6. **Group related points** - Key Takeaways use sub-bullets for related facets under one theme
7. **Broader topic sections** - Full Notes use fewer, broader headers
8. **Chronological** - Full Notes follow meeting flow
9. **Don't assume formats** - Don't say "one-pager" or "slide" unless certain; use neutral language ("description", "language")

## Section-Specific Rules

### Next Steps

- Use **"Team to"** for Seurat actions (not "Seurat to")
- Use **"[Client] to"** for client actions (not "[Client] core team to")
- Do NOT list individual names in "[Client] to" bullets unless a specific person owns a distinct action
- Do NOT include specific meeting times
- Sub-bullets max 3 lines; aim for 1-2
- Cut sub-bullets that are purely informational with no action
- Each distinct workstream gets its own "Team to" bullet

### Key Takeaways

- Main bullets should be **short** — aim for ~1-2 lines
- Focus on: client reactions, decisions, tensions, strategic implications
- Do NOT recap what Seurat presented or explained
- Do NOT explain what concepts/spaces mean (that is presentation content, not a takeaway)
- Do NOT include methodological notes (e.g., "no statistical changes were made")
- Sub-bullets allowed for grouping related facets, but keep them tight

### Full Notes

- Capture what the **client** said, asked, reacted to — this is the core purpose
- Minimize or omit descriptions of what the Seurat team presented or walked through
- Client questions/comments get main bullets; Team responses get sub-bullets only when the response matters
- Broader topic headers that match discussion themes, not individual sub-topics
