# Content Quality Guidelines

Good meeting notes aren't just formatted correctly - they capture **useful, actionable content**. This guide covers what makes content valuable vs. filler.

## Core Principle: Every Point Should Pass the "So What" Test

Before including any point, ask: "So what? What does this mean for next steps or future decisions?"

- ❌ "Client asked about brand placement"
- ✅ "Client flagged specific placement concerns (Olaplex in self care vs. bonding specialist) and requested indices to clarify ordering"

The second version captures the concern, gives a specific example, AND includes what they want done about it.

## Content Quality Patterns

### 1. Synthesize, Don't Transcribe

Long back-and-forth discussions should be distilled into consolidated points with clear implications.

**Raw transcript pattern:**
> "I'm wondering about X... Well actually let me think... The thing is... But on the other hand..."

**Notes should capture:**
> "Client flagged X as a concern, specifically noting [concrete example]. Discussion concluded that [resolution/action needed]."

### 2. Capture Underlying Concerns, Not Just Surface Questions

Go one level deeper than the literal question.

- Surface: "Client asked how brands were mapped"
- Underlying: "Client is confused about specific placements that feel unintuitive and wants transparency into methodology"

**Include:**
- The specific examples that triggered the question
- What would resolve their concern
- Any tension between their expectation and the data

### 3. Preserve Specific Examples

Specific examples make notes actionable. Include:
- Brand names when discussing placement concerns
- Specific benefit language being debated ("strength" vs. "health")
- Concrete suggestions made ("Quick Fix" framing)

**Example:**
> "Client flagged specific placement concerns (examples raised: science-forward brands appearing in 'self care' spaces; Olaplex in self care vs. bonding specialist; Nexxus in self care)"

### 4. Quote Key Phrases That Resonated

When someone uses memorable framing that captures an insight, preserve it in quotes:
- "center of gravity"
- "shoot for the stars"
- "Annie's 2010"
- "band-aid approach"

These phrases often become shorthand in future discussions.

### 5. Capture Rationale, Not Just Positions

Don't just note WHAT someone said - note WHY.

- ❌ "Client wants indices added"
- ✅ "Client requested adding indices next to brand placements to clarify the strength of association and ordering logic, noting it would help determine whether placements are 'marginal vs. strong (e.g., 110 vs 300)'"

### 6. Note Tensions and Nuances

When there's ambiguity or tension, capture it:
- "Discussion suggested X leans more into Y vs. Z being more narrowly W"
- "Client flagged the space may blend 'fixing a problem' with 'trying something new'"

### 7. Make Implicit Connections Explicit

If the same concern connects multiple discussion points, call it out:
- "Client emphasized retaining the styling component (not making it purely treatment/repair) and referenced implications for the 'Invite Play' growth driver linkage"

## What Makes Content "Useful" vs. "Filler"

### Useful Content:
- Decisions and alignments reached
- Specific concerns with examples
- Concrete asks and deliverables
- Tensions that need resolution
- Rationale behind positions
- Implications for next steps

### Filler to Avoid:
- What the Seurat team presented or explained (definitions, walkthrough of changes, methodology)
- Descriptions of what spaces/concepts mean — these are known; only capture client reactions
- "Team walked through X" or "Team explained X" — capture the client response instead
- General explanation of methodology (unless questioned)
- Background context already known
- Repetitive discussion points (consolidate)
- Raw data without interpretation
- Process details without implications
- "We discussed X" without the outcome
- Methodological notes (e.g., "no statistical changes were made")

## Detailed Next Steps Pattern

Strong notes include detailed next steps with specific sub-actions.

**Basic:**
> "Team to update brand mapping"

**Detailed (preferred):**
> "Team to update brand mapping deliverables:
>   - Add indices next to brands on the demand space chart
>   - Explore sharing top 1-2 demand spaces per brand"

**Rules for Next Steps:**
- Use **"Team to"** for Seurat actions (not "Seurat to")
- Use **"[Client] to"** for client actions — do NOT say "[Client] core team to" or list individual names unless a specific person owns a distinct action
- Do NOT include specific meeting times
- Sub-bullets max 3 lines; aim for 1-2
- Cut sub-bullets that are purely informational with no action (e.g., "Seurat will not attend" is unnecessary)
- Each distinct workstream gets its own "Team to" bullet
- Don't assume document formats — don't say "one-pager" or "slide" unless certain; use neutral language ("description", "language")

## Quick Checklist Before Finalizing

For each major point, verify:
- [ ] Does it pass the "so what" test?
- [ ] Is there a specific example where relevant?
- [ ] Is the underlying concern captured, not just the surface question?
- [ ] Is the resolution/action clear?
- [ ] Are key phrases that resonated preserved in quotes?

For the document overall:
- [ ] Are long discussions synthesized into consolidated points?
- [ ] Are redundant points merged?
- [ ] Is rationale captured, not just positions?
- [ ] Are next steps specific and actionable?
- [ ] Is the content focused on what the CLIENT said/asked/decided (not what Seurat presented)?
- [ ] Are Key Takeaway main bullets short (~1-2 lines, max ~2.5)?
- [ ] Are all sub-bullets 3 lines or fewer?
- [ ] Are Next Steps using "Team to" / "[Client] to" (not "Seurat to" or "[Client] core team to")?
