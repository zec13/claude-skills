**UNREAL Category Expansion Pre-WSII Alignment External 12.5.25**

*Seurat Team: Jill, Clara, Max, Nick*

*Unreal Team: Sophie, Alison*

**[Next Steps]{.underline}**

-   **Team to** carry forward nets from today's discussion into the WSII pre-read and deck
    -   Focus live time on gummies / cookies / brownies
    -   Set expectations that deprioritized categories will be addressed via pre-read

-   **Unreal to** send further thoughts on the recommended focus areas by Monday and bring an initial R&D perspective

**[Key Takeaways]{.underline}**

-   Alison reinforced that Unreal's **brand permission is rooted in ideals and standards,** and wants this "shoot for the stars" dynamic called out as new news

-   Sophie wants the next session **to define clear guardrails on sugar, taste and texture and sharpen how Unreal will differentiate** from current BFY gummies

-   The team **aligned that gummies' trend-driven nature is both a risk and a lever**, with Alison interested in exploring a faster drop / LTO go-to-market

-   **Cookies feel on-equity but emotionally and competitively trickier,** with Sophie probing how emotional challenges differ from chocolate and Alison stressing that which brands Unreal dupes and for what emotional job will be critical

-   **Protein is seen as misaligned with Unreal's core of clean ingredients**, and core team is comfortable deprioritizing

**[Full Notes:]{.underline}**

-   Brand DNA

    -   Alison asks how typical it is for a brand to have this level of "shoot for the stars" permission and whether Unreal's stretch is unique.

        -   Answer: Team shares that consumers express unusually broad openness to "Unreal anything," driven by love for the chocolate; compared with brands like Bonza, Unreal's permission is less constrained by form or meal occasion

        -   Alison interprets the permission as Unreal being "rooted toward a stake of ideals and standards as opposed to products," which allows consumers to imagine it credibly in many categories

    -   She wants this ideal/standard-based permission called out explicitly in the big meeting as something distinctive that other brands don't necessarily have

-   Gummy candy

    -   Sophie says she is not surprised gummies rose to the top of the consumer data and agrees that the three "pause buckets" called out feel directionally right

        -   She is "specifically curious" for the next work session to define:

            -   What specific sugar, taste and texture guardrails Unreal must hit for consumers to be compelled

            -   How Unreal would clearly differentiate from existing better-for-you competitors

    -   Alison asks whether consumers are "burned with all the innovation" in better-for-you gummies or still open to trying new brands

        -   Answer: Team notes that specific brands like SmartSweets and Joyride have likely burned some consumers, but the category remains highly trend-driven and experimental

-   Packaged cookies

    -   Sophie asks whether the "emotional challenges" in cookies are actually different from what Unreal has already navigated in chocolate

        -   Team responds that the emotional resonance is similar, which makes cookies feel less incremental versus chocolate than gummies do

    -   Alison underscores that "the positioning and what you are duping really matters" in cookies

-   Deprioritized Categories

    -   Sophie notes that "protein bites" were top of mind and expects questions from the broader team

        -   Answer from team is that Unreal's equity is in clean ingredients and no artificials, while protein spaces are overwhelmingly macros-led

    -   For cereal and cereal bars, there are no major client objections; focus remains on ensuring the pre-read clearly explains why they are deprioritized

## Key Patterns to Note

1. **Key Takeaways** are short complete sentences (~1-2 lines) with selective bolding
2. **Full Notes** use broader topic headers (e.g., "Brand DNA" not separate sub-sections)
3. **Client voice is primary** — client questions/comments get main bullets; Team responses get sub-bullets only when they matter
4. **No presentation recap** — notes don't describe what Seurat presented or explained
5. Specific names used when attribution matters (Sophie, Alison)
6. Focus is on decisions, reactions, tensions, and alignment
7. Sub-bullets stay under 3 lines
8. "Team to" for Seurat actions, "[Client] to" for client (no "core team", no listing names)
